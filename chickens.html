      <h3>Benefits of Raising Chickens</h3>
      <p class="p1">
        Chickens are a very easy animal to raise and care for. They are also
        very beneficial for your garden and your health. You can keep a chicken
        as a pet, for eggs, or for meat. Chickens can help reduce yard pests
        like fleas or ticks. If you garden, their waste can be used in compost,
        and their pecking and scratching habits help keep soil soft. If you
        purchase chicken feed, the eggs production will outweigh the cost of
        keeping them healthy.
      </p>
      <p class="p1">
        If you have decided you'd like to raise chickens, make sure you know
        what kind of chicken you'd like to raise. Different chicken breeds have
        differences in their capabilities. Some chickens grow bigger to be used
        for meat, many are very high egg-producers, and some are so gentle they
        can be kept as pets!

            Island Red, and was cast aside. The breed disappeared for 20 years

            colombian, partridge, silver, and white.

      <h5 class="sub-sec">Alternatives to Chickens</h5>
      <p class="p1 alternates">
        If you aren't sure about chickens specifically, there are other breeds
        of birds you can keep for any of the reasons listed above. You can keep
        quail, ducks, or geese. Quail are small and very quiet, but as a result,
        their eggs are very small as well. If this is not a problem, then they
        are a great alternative as they don't need much space, and are easy to
        maintain. Ducks are a bit louder than chickens, but their eggs are more
        valuable, and depending on the breed of duck, they can either be broody
        or non-broody. They will be happiest with a body of water to splash
        around in. You could use a small wading pool to satiate their desire for
        swimming. Geese are not a very common choice - they can be loud and - at
        times - aggressive. Geese are not necessarily aggressive, but they are
        more likely to become aggressive than the other two listed here. On the
        other hand, they produce very large eggs, and are big enough that
        cuddles are an option!
      </p>
      <br />
      <hr />
      <div class="chicken-coop">
        <h3 id="space">Prepare a Space</h3>
        <br />
        <p class="p1 alternates">
          The biggest limiter when making your flock is available space. If your
          chickens are not going to be free-range, then you have to supplement
          enough space in a run. You have to make sure both your coop and run
          can accomodate the number of chickens you want to have. In a coop, you
          want 2-3 square feet available per chicken. In a run, you want 4-5
          square feet available per bird. This will minimize fighting and make
          sure your chickens stay happier. Make sure you also do your best to
          keep the coop insulated and both the run and coop water-tight and
          well-vented. Standing water in the run can make chickens sick. Poor
          ventillation will increase the likelihood that the coop will stink and
          may increase predator activity.
