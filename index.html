        <h3>Why Homesteading?</h3>
        <p>
          Homesteading is a term used to describe different actions that some
          people do in order to generate their own food, without the need to
          generate a profit. It is a very healthy hobby or lifestyle that also
          gives back to the environment. This includes: raising animals for food
          like chickens, goats, sheep, or cows, gardening, composting,
          collecting rainwater, and preserving the extra food. It reduces
          overall waste production, as paper products, food waste can be
          composted, and since things are being stored, less plastic-covered
          product is purchased.

        <h3>Leaving Grass Behind</h3>
        <p>
          Grass is a trend that was started by royalty to show off how much land
          they could possess without having to use it for food. This, however,
          is a major waste of water. Turning lawns into home gardens, or even
          just replacing grass with a healthier option such as moss, clover,
          native ground-cover, or many others, reduces the amount of water
          consumed in order to "maintain property value". So long as more native
          plants are used, it will also improve the life of pollinators as well
          as oxygen quality in the area. These plants trend to require less
          maintenance as they are already acclimatized and will be more
          resilient to the surrounding environment.
